# Spam Detection App

A React Native application designed to detect and filter spam messages using a custom machine learning model.

## Features

- Classifies SMS messages as spam or not spam.
- User-friendly interface for easy interaction.
- Real-time detection and notifications.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-detection-app.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd spam-detection-app
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up the spam detection model.

## Machine Learning Model

- The model is trained on a dataset of SMS messages.
- Preprocessing steps include:
  - Removing unnecessary columns.
  - Text vectorization using CountVectorizer.
- Model architecture:
  - Input layer matching feature vector length.
  - Hidden layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation.
  - Output layer with 1 neuron for binary classification.
- Trained using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss.

## Improvements

- Optimize the TensorFlow Lite model for size and latency.
- Explore additional preprocessing techniques for better accuracy.
- Implement real-time updates for model retraining.
- Integrate user feedback mechanisms for model refinement.
- Ensure robust privacy measures for user data.
